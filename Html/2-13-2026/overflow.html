      It was a trial by spin for England as West Indies pipped them by 30 runs,
      led by Gudakesh Motie's brilliant 3 for 33, to top the Group C standings
      with two wins in as many games. Sherfane Rutherford's well-paced 76 not
      out carried West Indies through a period of consolidation and helped them
      post a commanding 196, before the spinners applied the stranglehold
      through the middle overs to deny England.
